# OSPO Newsletter 5


## ðŸ“– The OSPO Glossary

The OSPO Landscape Project has a new guide feature to capture in a single application most of the OSPO documentation mentioned within existing TODO resources (e.g [ospodefinition.org repo](https://github.com/todogroup/ospodefinition.org), [awesome OS Management Tool repo](https://github.com/todogroup/awesome-ospo) and more). This guide works with a simple [markdown file](https://github.com/todogroup/ospolandscape/blob/master/guide.md). Everyone can contribute to the OSPO guide by reviewing or adding new content!
Check the [OSPO Guide](https://landscape.todogroup.org/guide) to learn more.
