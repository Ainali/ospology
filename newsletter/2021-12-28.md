# OSPO Newsletter 5

## ðŸš€ TODO Annual Report

In 2021, weâ€™ve seen a growing number of organizations across all sizes and sectors (both private and public) investing in Open Source Programs more than ever. [This blog post](https://todogroup.org/blog/a-year-in-review-2021/) captures the 2021 TODO important milestones and OSPO trends in 2022.

## ðŸ“– The OSPO Guide

The OSPO Landscape Project has a new guide feature to capture in a single application most of the OSPO documentation mentioned within existing TODO resources (e.g [ospodefinition.org repo](https://github.com/todogroup/ospodefinition.org), [awesome OS Management Tool repo](https://github.com/todogroup/awesome-ospo) and more). This guide works with a simple [markdown file](https://github.com/todogroup/ospolandscape/blob/master/guide.md), so everyone can contribute to the OSPO guide by reviewing or adding new content to:

* OSPO Glossary
* OSPO Responsibilities & Categories
* OSPO Career Path
* OSPO Use Cases
* OSPO Learning

Check the [OSPO Guide](https://landscape.todogroup.org/guide) to learn more.
