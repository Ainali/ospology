# OSPO Newsletter 7

## New OSPO Research: Model and Archetypes

This report provides a model for end-user organizations across industries, and in different jurisdictions, to better understand the value of the OSPO, and where to get started. Readers will also come away with an understanding of OSPO Archetypes (or personas), which drive differentiation in OSPO behavior, all as a means to contextualize their unique path in the open source journey. The OSPO maturity model has been developed based on a series of interviews from leaders of noted OSPO programs, including some of the most influential technology firms such as Red Hat, Microsoft, SAP, and VMware, an more, as well as the OSPO survey data.

As the culmination of the research process, the whitepaper features three case studies of the evolution of  OSPOs in end-user organizations in different industry verticals: Bloomberg (financial services), Comcast (media), and Porsche (transportation/automotive). Each case is structured as a journey through the stages of the OSPO model to put it into practice.
